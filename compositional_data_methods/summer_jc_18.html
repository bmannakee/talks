# What is compositional data?
## And why can't we just do a standard two-sample multivariate t-test?

- Compositional data is any data vector whose sum is constrained to be equal to one and whose members are non-negative.

- The constraint generates a strong correlation between data points in the multivariate setting and confounds traditional statistical methods (Aitchison, 2003)

- This paper in particular focuses on the scaling problem, which arises from the fact that a `\(p\)`-dimensional compositional vector lies on a `\(p-1\)` dimensional hyperplane.

.pull-right[
- For any given vector `\(V\)` of raw counts that generates a composition with a given coordinate on the hyperplane, there are an infinite number of other vectors `\(cV\)` `\(\{c:c \in \mathbb{R}\}\)`, that generate that same coordinate.

- As a result, a multivariate test for differences in means can find significant differences between vectors that generate identical compositions (i.e. they are compositionally equivalent)

# What sorts of processes generate compositions?
### Mixing processes
- Gas mixtures
- Chemical reactions

### Count data, where the counts are only useful as estimates of fraction of total abundance
- Gene expression (always relative)
     - RNAseq
     - Arrays
- Microbiomes
     
### BONUS! compositions of compositions!!!
- Document topic modelling and classification
- Mutational process signatures in cancer genomes (my jam)

# A testable hypothesis of compositional equivalence

Suppose we have data matrices

`$$X^{(k)} = (X^{(k)}_1, \dots, X^{(k)}_{n_k})$$`
for groups `\((k=1,2)\)` such that
`$$\{(x_1, \dots, x_p) : x_j \gt 0 \;\; (j = 1, \dots, p), \quad \sum_{j=1}^p x_j = 1\}$$`
i.e, a matrix of compositions. Assume these compositions arise from some vector of latent variables that represent the true abundance of the things we are measuring, such that
`$$X_{ij}^{(k)} = W_{ij}^{(k)} \Big/ \sum_{l=1}^p W_{il}^{(k)} \quad (i = 1, \dots, n_k;\; j=1, \dots, p;\; k= 1,2)$$`
is the component-wise relationship between `\(X^{(k)}\)` and the variable of interest `\(W^{(k)}\)`.

The goal is to determine, using the measured quantities `\(X^{(k)}\)`, whether the `\(W^{(k)}\)` are samples from distributions with different means. In other words, is there a difference between the distributions of groups 1 and 2.

# A testable hypothesis of compositional equivalence
### A traditional multivariate t-test approach fails
Suppose the `\(W^{(k)}\)` are independent samples, each from a distribution with mean vector `\(\mu_k = E(W_1^{(k)}) \; (k=1,2)\)` and common covariance matrix `\(\Omega\)`. We would like to test the hypotheses
`$$H_0: \; \mu_1 = \mu_2 \quad \textrm{versus} \quad H_1: \; \mu_1 \ne \mu_2.$$` 

The scaling problem we have already discussed means we can not actually test this hypothesis through the observed `\(X^{(k)}\)`. Instead we could test for compositional equivalence using the hypotheses

`$$H_0: \; \mu_1 = c\mu_2\; \textrm{for some} \;c \in \mathbb{R}  \quad \textrm{versus} \quad H_1: \; \mu_1 \ne c\mu_2\; \textrm{for any}\; c \in \mathbb{R}.$$`
Unfortunately, rejecting `\(H_0\)` here does not imply rejecting `\(E(X_1^{(1)}) = E(X_1^{(2)})\)` because of the scaling factor, and thus does not lead to biological interpretations in terms of the underlying distributions.
